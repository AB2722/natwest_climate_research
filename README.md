# natwest_climate_research
My Natwest Work Experience Project on the effect of climate change on malaria deaths in Nigeria.

This Repository holds only the python code used to plot and analyse the data I have gathered.

Key Takeaways:
- Practice using pandas for data frames.
- Practice using MatPlotLib for plotting graphs.
- Practice using scipy and numpy to create functions for trendlines and calculating correlation coefficients.
